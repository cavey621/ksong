# Aircraft Boarding Strategy - Simulation Study

Airlines make revenue by running as more times of flight as they can. Minimizing boarding time effectively reduce the turnaround time, so that the airlines are able to schedule more rounds of flight for the short and middle distance trips. Plenty of boarding strategies have been implemented into daily operation by airlines. Unfortunately, none of them is a perfect plan to every airline since different airlines are stick to their own aim and company culture. However, the two strategies that currently popularized are back-to-front and outside-in strategy. 

In this project, we attempt to find the optimal method of grouping to minimize the passengerâ€™s boarding time via simulating the boarding process.
