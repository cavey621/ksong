# Logistics Operation Optimization

The company's current problem is to automate the daily process of sending a fleet of trucks located at a single depot to pick up some number of identical items at a fixed number of warehouses located in Ohio. On some days, there might be enough trucks to pick up all of the items at all of the warehouses; however, on other days there might not be enough trucks to do so. The goal of this project is to create VBA macros that determine how to use the fleet of trucks available each day to pick up as many of the items from the warehouses as possible in a single trip, given that each truck can only go to one warehouse.
